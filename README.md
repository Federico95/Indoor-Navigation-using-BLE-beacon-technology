# Indoor-Navigation-using-BLE-beacon-technology
The project is my 3rd year, and final project of my academic study at Middlesex University. 

The project consists of the creation of an Android app (Version >= Android Marshmellow) which lets the user detect their location inside a building in the Middlesex campus, select a destination and navigate there with the app's directions.

The app will also display information while the user passes by some point of interest, such as the Cafeteria, the library etc...It will display things such as opening times, discount and daily deals available etc...

Let's get to work!
