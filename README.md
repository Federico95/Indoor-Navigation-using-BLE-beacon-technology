# Indoor-Localization-using-BLE-beacon-technology
The project is my 3rd year, and final project of my academic study at Middlesex University. 

The project consists of the creation of an Android app (Version >= Android Marshmellow) which lets the user detect their location indoor. The software will then be able to calculate the amount of time the user spends in a specific place, which could be used in a smart home enviroment to study the behaviour of the person inside the house.

The app will also display information while the user passes by some point of interest.

Lastly, the user will be able to locate himself not only using beacons, but also, if they are out of range, by calculating the distance from another user's phone, which must be still in the beacons range. This idea has not yet been implemented and will be a very challenging one. 

P.s this repository is still a work in progress.
